## Overview

### Project Purpose

This project is a custom application for hotel resource and booking management, specifically designed for internal use by hotel administrators. With almost 40 reusable UI components and over 35 feature components, it features comprehensive management modules for bookings, guests, cabins, and check-in/check-out processes, complemented by an integrated business dashboard. Additionally, the application supports system settings and user authentication functionalities, including login, sign-up, and logout, tailored to the hotel's business operations.

### My role

As the developer of this full-stack web app, I am responsible for implementing the application's functionalities, guided by Jonas's design framework. The project's backend including database and Apis is developed using Supabase and is deployed on Vercel. I built complicated web app features and ensuring seamless front-end performance.

## Challenges

**1. Complicated Remote States Management**: Use `React Query` and `custom Hooks` to call `RESTful APIs` for hotel resources including Cabins, Bookings and Guests, including query, update, delete, sort and filter these resources.  
**2. User Authenticaition and Authorisation**: Protect hotel data and resouces using `RLS(Row level Security)` policies and enable users to log in, log out, sign up new user and update user credentials.  
**3. Comprehensive Dashboard Building**:Use `Recharts` library to build informative graphs and charts.  
**4. Intuitive and accessible User Experience**: `Prefetch data` to ensure seamless pagination, employ `Error Boundary` and React Query for efficient `error handling` and to manage `loading status` effectively and build visually-appealing `dark mode` to meet various needs.

## Technologies Used

This is a Single-Page Appication(SPA) based on `REACT`, `Javascript`, `JSX`, `HTML5` and `CSS3` and any other relevant tools (Supabase, Git, Vite, Vercel, etc.).
